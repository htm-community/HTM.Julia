## [WORK IN PROGRESS]

This aims to be a complete porting of the CLA infrastructure and implementations to [Julia](http://julialang.org).

## Why do this?

Simple: Check out [Julia's benchmarks](http://julialang.org/benchmarks/) and you'll know!
It writes and reads as simply as Python, but is as fast as C due to it's JIT compilation!
This will be implemented in such a way that it is easily compatible with the IJulia notebooks, which make building and experimenting with code incrediblly easy and interactive, just as the IPython notebooks, but 1000x faster! 

## TODOs & Ideas:

- [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) integration
- [Pycluster](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pycluster) intigration
- GPU intigration (like Mocha.jl)

## Roadmap:

- Start!
- Finish!
- Use & Love!
 
# Feel free to help & lean to love Julia!
